**Problem 29: Error Handling Middleware**

Problem Statement: You are developing a complex web application with multiple routes and middleware in Node.js and Express. 
                    You want to implement a centralized error handling mechanism to catch and handle errors gracefully without crashing the server. 
                      Design a middleware function that intercepts errors thrown by route handlers or other middleware and sends an appropriate error response to the client.

Function Signature:

function errorHandler(err, req, res, next) {
    // Your implementation here
}
